This project was made for freecodecamp.com's front end developer certification

It took ~4hrs to complete, although at 2 hours it was working but failing tests (wrong method) and at 3 hours it was passing all tests and just needed to be cleaned up

It usees mapping, refs, dynamic classes, and HTML5 audio interfaces along with CSS grid and flexbox

It uses [useEventListner](https://usehooks.com/useEventListener/) for the keyboard shortcuts

At one point it also used [use-sound](https://joshwcomeau.com/react/announcing-use-sound-react-hook/) to play audio

It was published using gh-pages
